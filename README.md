# File-encryption-with-chunking-system
This file encryption system breaks files into smaller chunks before encrypting them individually for enhanced security. Each chunk is encrypted using a symmetric encryption algorithm with unique initialization vectors, and decryption follows a similar process, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.
